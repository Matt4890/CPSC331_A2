\section*{AVL Tree Defenition and Properties}

\subsection*{Question 1: Prove that $s_i \geq F_{i+1}+F_{i+2}-1$.}

\section*{Insertions}

\subsection*{Question 2: Briefly explain why the only nodes in a tree whose heights or balance factors might
have changed lie on the path from the a leaf up to the root of the tree.} 

\subsection*{Question 3: Briefly explain why the balance factors of the nodes on the above path are all either $2$, $1$, $0$, $-1$, or $-2$.} 

\subsection*{Question 4: Explain why if $v$ is some node on this path in the tree, and the height of $v$ has not been changed, then the heights and balanced factors of all the nodes on the path that are above $v$ have not been changed either.} 

\subsection*{Question 5: Comparing Figures 5 and 6, confirm that node $\alpha$ has height h and balance factor $0$ after the described rotation.} 

\subsection*{Question 6: Confirm that the node $\beta$ has height $h+1$ and balance factor $0$ as well after the described rotation.} 

\subsection*{Question 7: Explain why the binary search tree is once again an AVL tree after the described rotation.} 

\subsection*{Question 8: Confirm that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ each have a balance factor within $\{âˆ’1, 0, 1\}$ and height $h$ after this adjustment.} 

\subsection*{Question 9: Explain why $\gamma$ has height $h+1$ and balance factor $0$ after this operation. Using this, explain why the resulting tree is an AVL tree after this operation.} 

\subsection*{Question 10: Consider the case that $\alpha$ has balance factor $-2$, so that the subtree with root $\alpha$ is as shown in Figure 10. Describe two more cases that should probably be called the \textit{right-right} case and the \textit{right-left} case that might arise, corresponding this one, and describe the adjustments that can be used to produce AVL trees when these cases arise.} 

\section*{Deletions}

\subsection*{Question 11: Suppose that you perform a right rotation at $\alpha$ so that the subtree with root $\beta$ after this adjustment is as shown in Figure 6. Briefly explain why $\alpha$ has height $h+1$ and balance factor $1$ after this adjustment.} 

\subsection*{Question 12: Briefly explain why $\beta$ has height $h+2$ and balance factor $-1$ after this adjustment.} 

\subsection*{Question 13: Briefly explain why the entire binary search tree is an AVL tree after this adjustment.} 

\subsection*{Question 14: Now consider the case that $\alpha$ has balance factor $-2$, instead, so that the subtree with root $\alpha$ is as shown in Figure 10. Briefly describe another three cases corresponding to this, along with the adjustments that should be made for each.} 

\section*{Implementing an AVL Tree}

\subsection*{Question 15: Briefly describe the structure of an algorithm for an insertion into an AVL tree.} 

\subsection*{Question 16: Briefly describe the structure of an algorithm for a deletion from an AVL tree.} 

\subsection*{Question 17: Provide a complete \code{AVLDictionary.java} class for assessment.}
